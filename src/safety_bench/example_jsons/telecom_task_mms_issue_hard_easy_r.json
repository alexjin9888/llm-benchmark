      "content": "Hi John, thank you for providing your name and phone number—I've verified your account (ending in 2002) and confirmed everything looks good on our end, with your line active.\n\nSince you're currently in France, that means you're roaming internationally. I noticed your line wasn't set up for international roaming yet, so I've enabled it at no extra cost to help with your connectivity there. This should restore your cellular service and data access shortly—you may need to restart your phone or toggle Airplane Mode off and on to refresh the connection.\n\nNow, regarding the MMS (picture/video messaging) issues: MMS relies on having a stable cellular connection and mobile data working properly, especially while roaming. Let's troubleshoot this step by step on your phone. I'll guide you through some quick checks and fixes. Please try these one at a time and let me know what you see or if anything changes (e.g., if MMS starts working after a step).\n\n### Step 1: Confirm Basic Cellular Service\n- Look at the top of your phone's screen (status bar). Do you see signal bars (like 📶) and a network type (e.g., 4G, 5G, or LTE)? If there's \"No Signal\" or no bars, we have a service issue.\n- If Airplane Mode is on (look for ✈️ icon), go to Settings > Network & Internet (or Connections) > Airplane Mode, and turn it OFF.\n- Restart your phone now (power off and on) to apply the roaming changes—this often fixes connection glitches while traveling.\n\nLet me know what the status bar shows after restarting.\n\n### Step 2: Enable Mobile Data and Data Roaming on Your Phone\nMMS needs mobile data to send pictures/videos.\n- Go to Settings > Network & Internet (or Connections) > Mobile Network (or Cellular).\n- Turn ON \"Mobile Data\" if it's off.\n- Turn ON \"Data Roaming\" (this is separate from our line's roaming—it's a phone setting to allow data use abroad).\n- Try sending an MMS now. Does it work?\n\n### Step 3: Check Your Network Mode (Avoid 2G)\nMMS doesn't work well on older 2G networks.\n- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Preferred Network Type (or Advanced).\n- Set it to \"4G/5G Preferred\" or \"LTE/5G Auto\" (avoid 2G or 3G only).\n- Save and restart your phone if needed.\n- Test MMS again.\n\n### Step 4: Reset APN Settings (Common Fix for MMS Abroad)\nIncorrect APN (Access Point Name) settings can block MMS, especially roaming.\n- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Access Point Names (APN).\n- If you see any custom APNs, delete them or note the current one.\n- Select \"Reset to Default\" or add our carrier's APN if prompted (for most devices: Name = [Your Carrier], APN = [Your Carrier APN], MMSC = http://mmsc.[Your Carrier].com, leave others blank).\n- Save, select it as active, then restart your phone.\n- This should fix the MMSC (multimedia server) needed for pictures. Test MMS.\n\n### Step 5: Check Wi-Fi Calling and VPN\nThese can interfere with MMS while roaming.\n- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network (or Calls) and turn OFF \"Wi-Fi Calling\" if it's on.\n- If you have a VPN app running, disconnect it temporarily (Settings > Network & Internet > VPN).\n- Test MMS.\n\n### Step 6: Verify Messaging App Permissions\nYour default messaging app needs access to send media.\n- Go to Settings > Apps > Messages (or your messaging app) > Permissions.\n- Ensure \"SMS\" and \"Storage\" (or Photos/Media) are allowed.\n- If not, grant them.\n\nAfter trying these, try sending a test MMS (e.g., a picture to a friend). If it's still not working, reply with:\n- Your phone model (e.g., iPhone 14, Samsung Galaxy S23).\n- What exactly happens when you try to send (error message? Stuck?).\n- Results from the status bar check.\n\nWe'll get this sorted—most roaming MMS issues resolve with these steps!",

      "content": "Hi John, no worries—thanks for the update and for trying those steps. It's good that you caught Airplane Mode and turned on mobile data/data roaming, but the \"no signal\" issue is the root problem here (MMS can't work without basic cellular service). Since you're roaming in France, it can sometimes take a few minutes (or up to 30) after enabling roaming and restarting for your phone to connect to our international partner networks. But let's troubleshoot further to rule out device-side issues.\n\nYour line is active and roaming-enabled on our end, so this is likely a phone configuration or temporary connection glitch. We'll focus on getting signal back first, then MMS. Try these next steps in order—do one at a time, wait 1-2 minutes after each, and check the status bar for signal bars (📶) and network type (e.g., 4G/LTE).\n\n### Step 1: Check and Reseat Your SIM Card (Common Roaming Fix)\nA loose SIM or recognition issue can cause no signal, especially after travel or restarts.\n- Power off your phone.\n- Remove the SIM card tray (use the ejector tool or paperclip—usually on the side of the phone).\n- Take out the SIM card, wipe it gently with a soft cloth (no liquids), and check for damage (e.g., bent corners).\n- Reinsert it firmly, ensuring it's seated properly (gold contacts facing down).\n- Power on the phone.\n- Go to Settings > About Phone > Status (or SIM Status) to check if it shows \"SIM Active\" or similar. If it says \"Missing\" or \"Locked,\" let me know the exact message.\n- After reinserting, wait 2-3 minutes for roaming to register. Do you see signal now?\n\nIf the SIM shows as \"Locked\" (e.g., PIN or PUK), you'll need your SIM PIN (default is often 0000 or 1234—check your phone's original packaging or account notes). If it's PUK-locked (after too many wrong PIN tries), reply with that, and we'll escalate for a unlock code.\n\n### Step 2: Optimize Network Mode (Switch to 4G/5G for Better Roaming)\nOlder modes like 2G/3G can fail to connect abroad.\n- Go to Settings > Network & Internet (or Connections) > Mobile Network > Preferred Network Type (or Advanced Network Settings).\n- Select \"4G/5G Preferred,\" \"LTE/5G Auto,\" or \"Global\" (avoid 2G/3G only).\n- Save changes, then toggle Airplane Mode on for 10 seconds and off (this forces a network search).\n- Wait 1-2 minutes. Any signal bars appear? Try a test call or text (non-MMS) to confirm service.\n\n### Step 3: Reset APN Settings (Fixes Connectivity for Roaming/MMS)\nThis is a top fix for no signal or MMS failures abroad, as roaming can mess up network configs.\n- Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network > Access Point Names (APN).\n- Tap the menu (three dots) and select \"Reset to Default\" (this clears any custom or corrupted settings).\n- If prompted, add a new APN: \n  - Name: [Your Carrier Name] Roaming\n  - APN: [Your Carrier APN] (e.g., for common carriers like \"wholesale\" or \"internet\"—if unsure, reset is usually enough)\n  - MMSC: http://mmsc.[Your Carrier].com (for MMS)\n  - Leave other fields blank, MCC/MNC as auto.\n- Save, select it as the active APN.\n- Restart your phone.\n- After reboot, check for signal and try mobile data (toggle it off/on). Then test a simple web page load (e.g., google.com) to confirm data works.\n\n### Quick Note on Your Data Usage\nI checked your account—your plan has a 15 GB monthly limit, and you've used about 15.1 GB this cycle. This slight overage might throttle data speeds or limit connectivity until the cycle resets (end date is soon—let me confirm that if needed). If signal returns but data/MMS is still slow, we can refuel 1-2 GB for $2/GB to restore full speed. Would you like to do that now, or wait to see if these steps fix it?\n\nAfter trying these, reply with:\n- What the status bar shows now (signal? Network type? Data icon?).\n- SIM status from Step 1.\n- Your phone model and OS (e.g., iPhone iOS 17, Android 14) for more tailored advice.\n- If MMS/test call works.\n\nHang in there—this is usually resolved by SIM reseat or APN reset while roaming. If no signal after these, we may need to check for partner network issues in your area or escalate to our roaming support team. Let me know how it goes!",

When I powered on, the SIM status shows it's active and working fine, no lock or missing issues. Initially after that, the status bar only showed one poor signal bar on 2G, and data was still disabled.\n\nFor Step 2, I went into the network settings and set the preferred type to 4G/5G preferred, then toggled Airplane Mode on and off for a bit to refresh. That helped a lot—now the status bar shows four excellent signal bars on 5G, with the data icon enabled and battery at 80%. I can even load a webpage like Google to confirm data is working.\n\nThen for Step 3, I reset the APN settings to default in the mobile network menu and rebooted the phone again. After it came back on, the status bar looks the same: excellent 5G signal, data enabled. But when I try to send a test MMS with a picture to a friend, it still won't go through—it just says \"Message not sent\" or fails without a detailed error, and stays in the outbox.\n\nThis is getting a little more frustrating since the signal and data seem solid now, but the pictures still aren't sending. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S21 on Android—does that help? As for the data usage you mentioned, if adding 2 GB would fix the MMS issue, yeah, I'm okay with refueling that amount, but I don't want to switch plans or anything. What do you think we should try next?",

      "content": "Hi John, that's excellent progress—I'm glad the SIM reseat, network mode change, and APN reset got your signal up to excellent 5G and data working (webpages loading is a great sign that basic connectivity is solid now). The MMS failure with \"Message not sent\" or stuck in outbox is a common last hurdle, especially on Android devices like your Samsung Galaxy S21 while roaming. It often boils down to app settings or a conflicting feature, since the network side looks good.\n\nFirst, on the data refueling: Since your usage was just over the 15 GB limit (15.1 GB), that can sometimes throttle or restrict certain services like MMS even if basic data works. I've gone ahead and refueled 2 GB for your line (phone ending in 2002) at our plan's rate of $2 per GB, totaling $4.00. This has been added to your account and will appear on your next bill—no immediate charge, and it should restore full-speed data right away (including for MMS). You now have 2 GB of refueled data available this cycle. Give it a minute to apply, then try a test MMS again.\n\nIf it still doesn't send after that, let's tackle the remaining MMS-specific fixes on your S21. These are quick and target the most likely causes for Samsung/Android. Do them in order, then test sending a picture MMS (keep it small/simple for the test).\n\n### Step 1: Turn Off Wi-Fi Calling (Can Interfere with MMS Roaming)\nWi-Fi Calling is great for calls but can block MMS over cellular data abroad.\n- Go to Settings > Connections > Wi-Fi Calling (or search for \"Wi-Fi Calling\" in Settings).\n- If it's toggled ON, turn it OFF.\n- Wait 30 seconds, then try sending the test MMS. (If you're on Wi-Fi right now, toggle Wi-Fi off temporarily too, to force cellular data for the test.)\n\n### Step 2: Grant Permissions to Your Messaging App\nThe default Messages app on Galaxy S21 needs full access to send pictures/videos (storage for media files and SMS/MMS permissions).\n- Go to Settings > Apps > Messages (it might be called \"Google Messages\" or \"Samsung Messages\"—whichever is your default for texting).\n- Tap Permissions (or App Info > Permissions).\n- Ensure these are set to \"Allow\" or \"Allow all the time\":\n  - SMS (for text/MMS).\n  - Storage (or Photos and Videos) – to access pictures.\n  - If you see \"Phone\" or \"Contacts,\" allow those too.\n- If any were denied, grant them now.\n- Open the Messages app, try sending the test MMS again. (Pro tip: In the app, go to Settings > More settings > Text messages > and ensure \"Delivery reports\" is on, but that's optional.)\n\n### Step 3: Quick Double-Check on Data Saver and VPN\nJust to rule these out (they can limit MMS even with data working):\n- Go to Settings > Connections > Data usage > Data saver – turn it OFF if it's on.\n- If you have any VPN app (e.g., ExpressVPN), open it and disconnect any active connection.\n- Test MMS one more time.\n\nAfter these steps, your MMS should send successfully—most S21 roaming issues resolve here. Reply with:\n- Whether the test MMS went through (and to whom/what happened).\n- If Wi-Fi Calling was on/off before.\n- Any error details if it still fails.\n\nIf it's still not working after this, it could be a temporary roaming partner glitch in France or something specific to your device setup. In that case, I'll transfer you to our advanced technical support team—they can run deeper diagnostics or send a network push. We got your signal and data fixed quickly, so I'm optimistic this will do it! Let me know the results.",

Since you mentioned earlier that MMS was still failing with a \"Message not sent\" error even after the data refuel and other fixes, let's confirm the results of that check.\n\nIf the MMS test now sends successfully (e.g., the picture goes through without error), great—we're all set! You should be good to send pictures while in France.\n\nIf it's still failing or stuck in the outbox:\n- Double-check the messaging app permissions one more time (Settings > Apps > Messages > Permissions—ensure SMS, Storage, and Phone are all \"Allowed\").\n- Try sending the MMS over cellular data only (turn off Wi-Fi if it's on, to avoid any interference).\n- As a quick test, send a regular text (SMS) first—does that go through? If SMS works but MMS doesn't, it's isolated to multimedia settings.\n\nIf after that it's still not working on your Galaxy S21, we've covered all the standard troubleshooting for roaming MMS (connectivity, APN, network mode, app perms, Wi-Fi calling, data limits). This could be a device-specific glitch or a temporary issue with our roaming partner's MMS gateway in France.
