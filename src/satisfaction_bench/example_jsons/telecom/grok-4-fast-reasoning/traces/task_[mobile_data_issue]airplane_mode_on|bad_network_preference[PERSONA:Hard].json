It looks like you have multiple lines associated with your account. The phone number you provided (555-123-2002) seems to be your primary contact, but to ensure we're troubleshooting the correct line, could you confirm if that's the phone experiencing the mobile data issues?\n\nIn the meantime, let's start diagnosing the problem on your device. Mobile data issues can often be fixed with simple checks. Please follow these steps one by one and let me know what you see:\n\n1. **Check if Airplane Mode is on**: Look at the top of your phone's screen (status bar). Do you see an airplane icon (✈️)? If yes, swipe down from the top of the screen (or go to Settings > Network & Internet > Airplane Mode) and turn it off.\n\n2. **Check mobile data status**: Go to Settings > Network & Internet > Mobile Network (or similar, depending on your phone). Is \"Mobile Data\" toggled on? If not, turn it on.\n\nLet me know the results, and we'll proceed from there!",

Now that it's off and mobile data is enabled, let's verify if things are working better.\n\nPlease try these quick checks on your phone:\n\n1. **Look for signal bars**: At the top of your screen, do you now see signal strength bars (like 📶) and a network type (e.g., 5G, 4G, LTE)? If there's no signal or it says \"No Service,\" let me know.\n\n2. **Test your data**: Open a web browser (like Chrome or Safari) and try loading a simple site, such as google.com. Does it load quickly, or is it still slow/stopping? Alternatively, if you have an app like YouTube, try playing a short video.\n\nIf it's still not working properly, we'll dig deeper—could be something like data limits, roaming settings, or network preferences.

      "content": "Yes, 2G is quite outdated and very slow for internet browsing or apps—it's designed more for basic calls and texts, not modern data usage, so that explains the sluggish performance even with signal bars showing. The good news is we can try switching your phone's network preference to prioritize faster options like 4G or 5G, which should improve things if coverage is available in your area. This is a common fix for slow data.\n\nLet's do this step by step on your phone (the instructions are for Android; if you're on iPhone, let me know, as the menu names differ slightly):\n\n1. **Open Settings**: Swipe down from the top of your screen and tap the gear icon, or find the Settings app.\n\n2. **Go to Network Settings**: Tap \"Network & Internet\" (or \"Connections\" on some phones), then \"Mobile Network\" (or \"SIM & Network\" or \"Cellular\").\n\n3. **Select Preferred Network Type**: Look for \"Preferred network mode,\" \"Network mode,\" or \"Advanced\" > \"Preferred network type.\" Tap it.\n\n4. **Choose a Faster Option**: Select something like \"5G/LTE/4G auto\" or \"4G/5G preferred\" (avoid anything with \"2G\" or \"3G only\"). If you see options, pick the one that includes 5G or LTE if available.\n\n5. **Save and Test**: Back out of the menus (it should apply automatically). Then, wait 10-30 seconds for your phone to reconnect, and try loading Google again in your browser. Do you see the network type change to 4G, LTE, or 5G in the status bar?\n\nIf it doesn't change or data is still slow after this, we might need to check your data usage (to see if you've hit your plan's limit) or other settings like data saver mode. Also, poor signal (just one bar) could be due to your location—try moving to an open area if possible. Let me know what happens after trying this!",
