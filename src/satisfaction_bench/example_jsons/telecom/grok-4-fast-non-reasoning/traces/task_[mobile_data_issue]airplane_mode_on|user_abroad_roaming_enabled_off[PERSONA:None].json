To help troubleshoot and get you fast internet speeds, I'll need to guide you through some quick checks and fixes on your device. First, could you please provide your phone number (including country code) so I can verify your account and line details? This will let me check things like your roaming status and data usage.\n\nIn the meantime, let's start with a basic diagnostic: Please run the `check_network_status` command on your device and let me know what it shows (e.g., signal strength, if mobile data is enabled, and data roaming status).

With Airplane Mode off, cellular connected on 5G, mobile data and roaming enabled, and no issues showing up, you're all set on the basics.\n\nA couple of quick things to keep in mind for the best experience abroad:\n- Monitor your data usage to stay under your 15 GB monthly limit (you're currently at 8.7 GB used). If you get close, we can refuel more data if needed.\n- If you notice any drop in speed later (e.g., due to network congestion), try running `check_network_status` again or toggling to a preferred network mode with `set_network_mode_preference` set to \"4g_5g_preferred\" for optimal performance.\n- When you return home, you can toggle Data Roaming back off to avoid accidental charges, though roaming is free on your plan.\n\nIf everything stays good, no further action is required.
