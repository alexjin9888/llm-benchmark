Your phone isn't necessarily broken; this is often a simple fix like a setting toggle or SIM issue. Let's start troubleshooting safely.\n\nFirst, let's check if Airplane Mode is on (it disables all connections, including signal). Please use the \"toggle_airplane_mode\" feature on your phone (in settings under \"Network & Internet\" or \"Connections\"—turn it off if it's on). Then, run \"check_status_bar\" again and let me know what it shows for signal and Airplane Mode. If it's still no signal, we'll move to checking your SIM card next.

Since there's still no signal after checking Airplane Mode, the next common cause is your SIM card not being properly seated or recognized (it's the chip that connects your phone to our network). Let's check that.\n\nPlease use the \"check_sim_status\" feature on your phone (look in Settings > About Phone > SIM Status, or search for \"SIM\" in your settings).

      "content": "Thank you for checking that, John. A \"SIM card locked with a PIN code\" means your phone's SIM (the chip inside) is protected by a security PIN that you (or someone) set up previously—it's like a password to unlock the SIM for network access. This is why you're seeing no signal; the phone can't connect until the PIN is entered correctly. Don't worry, it's a common feature and not a sign of anything broken. Since you don't remember setting one, it might be a default from when the SIM was activated (often 0000 or 1234), or something you chose earlier.\n\nHere's how to fix it step by step—take a deep breath, we'll get through this:\n\n1. On your phone, when it prompts for the SIM PIN (it might appear on startup or in the SIM settings), enter a common default like **0000** or **1234**. If that doesn't work, try any PIN you might have used for other accounts (like your voicemail or device lock).\n\n2. If it accepts the PIN, great! Your signal should return immediately. Then, run \"check_status_bar\" again to confirm you see signal bars (like 📶), and try making a test call.\n\n3. If the wrong PIN is entered too many times (usually 3 attempts), the SIM will lock further with a \"PUK code\" (an 8-digit unlock code unique to your SIM). In that case, **do not enter more guesses**—stop and let me know. We'll need to escalate this to our technical support team for the PUK code, as I can't provide it here for security reasons. To do that safely, I'll transfer you to a human agent who can verify and assist right away.\n\nCan you try entering a PIN now and tell me what happens? If it locks with PUK, just say so, and we'll handle the transfer. You're almost there!",
