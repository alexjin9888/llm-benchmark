You have multiple lines associated with your account (ending in 2002, and two others). To troubleshoot your mobile data issue specifically, could you confirm which phone number is experiencing the problem? If it's the one you provided (555-123-2002), great—we can proceed with diagnostics on that line.\n\nIn the meantime, let's start by checking the basic status of your device's network and data connection. Please run the following diagnostic on your phone:\n\n1. Go to your phone's settings or dialer and use the command `check_status_bar` (or follow your phone's built-in diagnostic menu if available). This will show us icons for signal strength, mobile data status, and more.\n\nLet me know what it reports, and we'll go from there!",

Use the command `toggle_airplane_mode` (or go to your phone's quick settings panel—usually by swiping down from the top of the screen—and tap the airplane icon to disable it).\n\nOnce you've done that, run `check_status_bar` again to confirm Airplane Mode is now off, and also try `run_speed_test` to check your data speed.

A speed test result of around 0.05 (which sounds like \"very poor\" or no real connection) means we're still not getting a solid mobile data link, but we can troubleshoot further step by step. Don't worry; we'll figure this out systematically.\n\nSince your account is active and the line for 555-123-2002 (ID: L1001) shows no issues on our end like suspension or data limits exceeded, let's check a few more things on your device to pinpoint the problem. Please run these diagnostics one at a time and share the results:\n\n1. `check_network_status` - This will show your signal strength, if mobile data is enabled, and data roaming status (in case you're in a low-coverage area).\n\n2. `check_data_restriction_status` - This checks if Data Saver mode or other limits are restricting your speed.\n\nOnce you have those, we can take the next steps, like toggling data or checking for other settings.

      "content": "Thank you for those details, John—that's very helpful. Yes, the \"poor signal on 2G\" is a big clue here: 2G networks are outdated and extremely slow for data (they're mainly for basic calls and texts, not internet), which explains the 0.05 speed. It's not necessarily that the signal is \"bad\" overall—it could be that your phone is stuck connecting to the older 2G network instead of a faster one like 4G or 5G, even if better coverage is available nearby. Since your line is active and data-enabled, we can try optimizing your phone's network preferences to prioritize faster networks.\n\nLet's fix this next:\n\n1. Run `set_network_mode_preference` with the mode set to \"4g_5g_preferred\" (this tells your phone to seek out 4G or 5G connections, which should dramatically improve data speed if available in your area).\n\nAfter that, please run `check_network_status` again to see if the network type has updated (hoping for 4G/5G and better signal), and then `run_speed_test` to check the speed. If it improves to \"fair\" or better, great—we're done! If not, we'll check a couple more things like APN settings or data usage on your line.\n\nLet me know the results!",
