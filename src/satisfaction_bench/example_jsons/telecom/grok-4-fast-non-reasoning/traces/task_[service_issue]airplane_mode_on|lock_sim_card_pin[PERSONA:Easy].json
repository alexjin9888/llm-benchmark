Enter your current PIN code when prompted on your phone (it's usually the one you set up initially, or a default from the carrier—common defaults are 0000 or 1234, but check your account records if you don't remember).\n2. Once entered correctly, your SIM should become active, and service should return.\n\nIf you don't know or have forgotten the PIN, or if you've entered it incorrectly too many times (which might lock it further with a PUK code), we can't reset it here for security reasons. In that case, please reply with that detail, and I'll transfer you to a human technical support agent who can assist with PIN/PUK recovery or SIM replacement.\n\nTry entering the PIN now and let me know if it unlocks successfully—then run \"check_status_bar\" again to confirm signal is back.",
