Looking at your current billing cycle (ends 2025-02-28), you've used 15.1GB, which exceeds the limit. This is likely why your mobile data is cutting out or extremely slow—once the limit is hit, we throttle speeds to very low levels (like 128kbps) to prevent full cutoff, but it's not suitable for fast internet like browsing or streaming.\n\nTo get you really fast cellular data back quickly, we have two main options: (1) refuel data to add more allowance right away (up to 2GB max, at $2 per GB on your plan), or (2) upgrade to a higher-data plan for the long term. Refueling is the fastest fix and will apply instantly to this line.\n\nHow much data would you like to refuel (e.g., 1GB for $2 or 2GB for $4)? Or would you prefer to explore plan upgrade options first? Let me know, and we'll get it sorted!",

This brings your available data to 2GB of high-speed allowance right away, so your cellular internet should now be back to full speed (no more throttling).\n\nTo ensure everything is working smoothly:\n- Turn off Data Saver mode if it's on (this can limit speeds).\n- Restart your phone to refresh the connection.\n- Run a quick speed test on your device to confirm.\n\nIf your data still feels slow after a few minutes or you run into any other issues, let me know the details (like your current signal strength or speed test results), and we'll troubleshoot further.

The 2GB addition should have restored full-speed access immediately, but sometimes it takes a minute for the network to update, or there could be a device-side issue like settings or signal problems.\n\nTo diagnose this properly, let's check a few key things on your phone's end. Could you please run these quick checks for me? Just reply with the results, and I'll guide you on the next steps:\n\n1. **Check your status bar**: Look at the top of your screen—what icons do you see for signal strength (e.g., bars or \"No Signal\"), network type (like 5G, 4G), and mobile data (e.g., \"Data Enabled\" or off)?\n\n2. **Check network status**: Is mobile data turned on? Any mention of airplane mode or data roaming?\n\n3. **Run a speed test again**: If possible, try it once more after restarting your phone (hold the power button and select restart).\n\nAlso, are you in an area with good coverage (indoors/outdoors, urban/rural)? Once I have those details, we can pinpoint if it's a signal issue, settings glitch, or something else and fix it fast. Hang tight!",
