It includes one passenger (yourself) and was paid via credit card for $128 total, with no checked baggage.\n\nRegarding travel insurance: Our records show that insurance was not added to this reservation (it's listed as \"no\"). This could explain why it's not appearing in your online check. If you'd like to add insurance now, note that our policy only allows this at the time of initial booking—unfortunately, we can't add it after the fact for this reservation. If this doesn't match what you recall or if there's another issue, could you provide more details about when/where you believe you added it?

I've double-checked your reservation (PEP4E0) in our system, and unfortunately, the insurance is still showing as \"no\" for your booking specifically. It doesn't appear to have been added during the initial purchase on May 5, 2024.\n\nRegarding your family's bookings: If they're under separate reservations, I can review those as well to confirm their insurance status and see if there's any connection or error. Could you provide their user IDs or reservation numbers? That might help identify if there was a processing issue.\n\nAs for adding insurance now, our policy strictly limits it to the time of initial booking only—we're unable to add or apply it retroactively to existing reservations like yours. This is to ensure coverage terms are clear from the start. However, since your trip is upcoming (May 20, 2024), I can explore alternatives:\n\n- **Third-party insurance**: I recommend checking options through reputable providers like Allianz or Travel Guard, which can often cover trips even close to departure (as long as it's before you leave). They might align with your needs for health or weather-related issues.\n- **Membership benefits**: If you're a silver or gold member, you may have some built-in protections—do you know your membership level? I can pull your user profile to confirm if that helps.\n- **Compensation or refund**: If you can provide proof (e.g., confirmation email or receipt) that you intended to add insurance and it wasn't processed correctly, we could look into a goodwill gesture, such as a travel certificate or partial refund for the difference. But without that, our hands are tied per policy.\n\nIf this doesn't resolve it or you'd prefer to speak with a supervisor for a deeper review, I can transfer you to a human agent right away.

      "content": "I'm truly sorry for the ongoing concern, Sophia—this must be stressful, especially with your family traveling together. I completely understand wanting full coverage for peace of mind on your May 20 trip.\n\nTo address your request, I've pulled your full user profile under sophia_taylor_9065. It confirms your silver membership (which includes some enhanced baggage perks but doesn't extend to retroactive insurance additions) and lists four active reservations associated with your account: PEP4E0 (your one-way basic economy flight from CLT to PHX), plus 6NSXQU, J3SAZF, and NABCQ2. These could potentially be the linked family bookings you mentioned—do any of those match your family's reservations? If so, I can review their details right away to check for insurance status and see if there's a connection or processing error (e.g., if they were booked in a group but split into separate records).\n\nRegarding overriding the policy to add insurance to PEP4E0 now: Unfortunately, I cannot do that—our system and guidelines strictly prohibit adding travel insurance after the initial booking date (which was May 5 for yours). This is a non-negotiable rule to maintain clear coverage terms, and even as a silver member, it doesn't qualify for an exception here. There's no override available through my tools or access.\n\nThat said, since your family has it on their bookings, let's verify those to potentially resolve this:\n- If one of the other reservations under your ID includes your family's flights with insurance, we might be able to link or adjust visibility in your online account.\n- If they're under different user IDs, please share those details (or reservation numbers), and I'll check immediately.\n\nIn the meantime, for immediate protection on your specific booking, I strongly recommend purchasing standalone trip insurance today through a third-party like Allianz Global Assistance—they offer policies that can cover cancellations for health/weather reasons, often starting at around $20-30 for your trip length, and can be bought up until departure. I can guide you on how to do that if helpful.\n\nIf confirming the other reservations doesn't help or you'd like me to escalate this internally for a one-time goodwill option (like a travel certificate equivalent to the insurance value, ~$30), just say the word. How would you like to proceed—shall I pull details on one of those other reservations now?",

Insurance: No. Created May 5, 2024.\n- **J3SAZF**: Round-trip business class from LGA to PHX on May 18-19, 2024 (three passengers: you, Lucas Davis, and Mason Khan). Insurance: Yes. Created May 5, 2024. (This one has insurance and includes family members.)\n- **NABCQ2**: One-way basic economy from BOS to MSP on May 15-16, 2024 (single passenger: you). Insurance: Yes. Created May 3, 2024.\n\nThese are all separate bookings under your account, but they don't share the exact same flights as your PEP4E0 reservation (CLT to PHX on May 20, which is also basic economy, single passenger, no insurance). While J3SAZF and NABCQ2 do have insurance added (likely because it was selected during those bookings), there's no system link or group processing error evident here that would automatically apply it to PEP4E0. Each reservation is handled independently, and insurance must be opted into at the time of creation—there's no way to retroactively \"link\" or transfer it from one to another per our policies.\n\nI'm sorry, but I cannot add insurance to PEP4E0 at this point, even as a silver member or due to the family context. Our guidelines are firm on this to ensure proper coverage activation from the start, and my tools don't allow overrides or post-booking additions. This isn't something I can fix on our end without violating those rules.\n\nSince this is crucial for your trip and third-party options aren't appealing, the best path forward is to escalate to a human agent who can review for any exceptional goodwill resolution (e.g., a travel certificate to cover potential issues, valued at ~$30 for your single-passenger booking). I'll initiate that transfer now with a summary of your situation.\n\n",
