8PM-10PM: comprehending tasks, initial look at 4 benchmarks, setup xai API promo code and key, diving through each benchmark's features, leaderboards, github etc.

10PM: reduced search down to tau2 and terminal, tau seems outdated and agi seemed heavier as it required a lot of UI interactions

10PM-11PM: setup tau2, experimented with smoke case to test runnability

11PM-12AM: setup terminal and docker, experimented with smoke case to test runnability
